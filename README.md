# Hi, I'm Sumon! 

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a software engineering student at 42 Vienna, diving into the IT world
with a passion for hands-on learning. Even though I haven't worked in tech
yet, I'm super eager to solve real-world problems. I want to turn my
curiosity into cool solutions that make a difference. I believe challenges
are just chances to learn, and I'm all about working together and being
proactive. My goal? Not just keeping up with tech changes, but also being
part of making them happen!
